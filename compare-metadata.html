Game AI Mechanics

Corruption Mechanism
• After state establishment, corruption value gradually increases over time
• Corruption accumulation speed affected by:
  
Population: High population (Malthusian trap) accelerates corruption
Economy: Treasury deficit accelerates corruption
• High corruption triggers potential background reform event (no event text yet), resetting corruption value

Population System
• Provincial population cap based on current ecosystem
• Population growth rate affected by ethnic attributes
• Wars cause population decline
• Low population reduces willingness to initiate wars
• Population determines troop replenishment rate

Economy and Specialty System
• Provincial resources determined by ecosystem
• Economic output affected by ethnic attributes and state system
• Military expenses depend on troop mobilization
• Administrative efficiency determined by territorial size
• Taxation based on population and specialties
• Wars reduce economic output to zero
• Corruption affects tax efficiency
• Treasury deficit reduces willingness to initiate wars

Core Area
• Expands over time from capital
• Emergency mobilization when threatened
• Mobilization scale affected by corruption and economy
• Leaves national ethnic imprint, deepening with time
• Removes extinct nations' imprints

Rebellion and Nation Restoration System
• Rebellion probability increases with distance from core
• Remote areas prone to rebellion during high corruption
• Rebellions may restore old nations in provinces
• Extreme corruption may cause core area rebellions 
Combat System
• Army effectiveness affected by terrain, economy, corruption, national traits
• Internal operations: easier supply, lower expenses
• Expeditions/overseas: higher consumption and expenses
• Surrounded troops in "salient", halved effectiveness
• Island strategy: Frequent harassment of continental nations
  
May overextend continental armies
• Distant overseas operations: maritime, commercial, or powerful nations only
• Armies prioritize border deployment
• Army types: garrison, imperial guards, field troops
  
Field: foreign attacks
Guards: rebellion suppression
Garrison: stationing
• Threatened capital improves army efficiency, changes troop roles
• Fortresses: Mountain-built, hard to conquer

Diplomatic System
Basic Political System Relations
Republic/Federal
• Friendly: republics, federal systems
• Good: kingdoms
• Tense: tribal systems
• Opposed: empires, theocracies

Empire
• Close: kingdoms
• Neutral: tribal, theocratic
• Tense: republics, federal
• Competitive: other empires

Kingdom
• Good: republics, federal, other kingdoms
• Slightly good: theocracies
• Neutral: tribal
• Slightly tense: empires

Tribal
• Close: other tribes
• Neutral: kingdoms, theocracies
• Tense: republics, federal, empires

Theocracy
• Good: kingdoms
• Neutral: tribal
• Tense: republics, federal, empires
• Potential conflicts: other theocracies
• Special: Strong religious propagation

National Power and Diplomacy
Strong Country Effect:
• Overly powerful countries face deteriorating relations
Corruption and War Risk:
• Powerful but corrupt countries vulnerable to attacks

Dynamic Diplomacy
• Relations change based on: common enemies, history, power, corruption
• Theocracies: strong religious conversion
• Overly powerful allies may dissolve alliances

Randomness
• Systems not absolute, random factors simulate low-probability events

Hey mapmakers, here’s what changed in today’s build:

Alliance management is now feature-complete: rename alliances, recolor them, tap the 2 key to flip into alliance view, lock an alliance so it never dissolves, and boot unruly members.
Added a capital jump shortcut—click the capital entry in the Country panel’s Basic Info to pop open the capital province panel and snap the camera to it.
Boosted the odds of successful family purges while slightly lowering the interval and chance of family rebellions.
Fixed mutually exclusive traits spawning together when new characters initialize.
Fixed the Cruel trait so it now actually applies its effects.

Next up: we’re prepping the first set of family-editing tools for the following update.
